# Questionnaire Accordion

A sample react project to demonstrate components, nesting components and use of React hook: `useState()` to manage the state of data and render them into components. The source of data is the json located in: `data.js`.

The data is nicely represented in Accordion style with single toggle functionality by sharing the active props among the children components.
